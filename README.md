### About 

This was one of my first React Native projects, that i created as a study project. It's a simple NCAA Women's Basketball (NCAA WBB) app that displays team rankings and mocked schedules. It implements
some fundamental concepts like stylesheet styling, nested navigation, and data fetching :)

### Features
- View NCAA WBB rankings.
- Explore mocked schedules for upcoming games.
